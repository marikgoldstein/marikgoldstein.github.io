Hello.
My name is Mark Goldstein.
I am a Russian-American living in Boston-area, USA.

These are some obsessions of mine, by keyword:
    - music and sound
    - computer science
    - machine learning
    - artificial intelligence
    - music information retrieval
    - operating systems + other large systems
    - signal processing
    - acoustics
    - psychoacoustics
    - natural language processing
    - music recommendation
    - composition
    - semiotics
    - inari
</p>

<p>
Formerly, I studied composition at New England Conservatory of Music.
Technically, I was in the [Contemporary Improvisation] department.
My teachers there were: 
    - Anthony Coleman
    - [Stratis Minakakis]
    - [Ran Blake]
    - Laurie Frink
    - Ken Radnofsky
    - Joe Morris

At NEC, I was a teaching assitant for a course on the music of Duke Ellington.

<p>
Presently, I am a researcher, teaching fellow, and special student
at Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS),
in the computer science department. I am in [Margo Seltzer]'s lab, where
I contribute to the [PRINCESS] project (operating system code synthesis).
I am planning to apply to graduate programs in computer science
during Fall 2017 for Fall 2018 start.
</p>

<p>
I am in the process of starting a research group for music processing,
music information retrieval, computational musciology, signal processing,
and more generally music-related machine learning and artificial intelligence.
More information can be found [here]. Tentative name: 

    Harvard PRISM
    Processing and Retrieval of Information from Sound and Music

One offshoot of this is that I am also teaching a weekly
summer course in introductory computer science and signal processing
at New England Conservatory. Information can be found [here]
