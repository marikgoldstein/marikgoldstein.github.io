Hello.</br>
My name is Mark Goldstein.</br>
I am a Russian-American living in Boston-area, USA.</br>
</br>
<pre>
These are some obsessions of mine, by keyword:
    - music and sound
    - computer science
    - machine learning
    - artificial intelligence
    - music information retrieval
    - operating systems + other large systems
    - signal processing
    - acoustics
    - psychoacoustics
    - natural language processing
    - music recommendation
    - composition
    - semiotics
    - inari

</br>
Formerly, I studied composition at New England Conservatory of Music.</br>
Technically, I was in the [Contemporary Improvisation] department.</br>
<pre>
My teachers there were:
    - Anthony Coleman
    - [Stratis Minakakis]
    - [Ran Blake]
    - Laurie Frink
    - Ken Radnofsky
    - Joe Morris

</br>
At NEC, I was a teaching assitant for a history course</br>
on the music of Duke Ellington.</br>
</br>
Presently, I am a researcher, teaching fellow, and special student</br>
at Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS),</br>
in the computer science department. I am in [Margo Seltzer]'s lab, where</br>
I contribute to the [PRINCESS] project (operating system code synthesis).</br>
I am planning to apply to graduate programs in computer science</br>
during Fall 2017 for Fall 2018 start.</br>
</br>
I am in the process of starting a research group for music processing,</br>
music information retrieval, computational musciology, signal processing,</br>
and more generally music-related machine learning and artificial intelligence.</br>
More information can be found [here]. Tentative name:</br>
</br>
<pre>
    Harvard PRISM
    Processing and Retrieval of Information from Sound and Music
</pre>
</br>
One offshoot of this is that I am also teaching a weekly</br>
summer course in introductory computer science and signal processing</br>
at New England Conservatory. Information can be found [here]</br>
</br>
<pre>
Harvard Courses for which I have been a teaching fellow include:

    - CS61:     Systems Programming and Machine Organization
