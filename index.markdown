## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences,
advised by [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/) and 
[Thomas Wies](https://cs.nyu.edu/wies/). I work on survival analysis, 
causal inference, and representation learning problems with a focus on machine learning for health.


## News

* Fall 2021: *Learning Invariant Representations with Missing Data* accepted to NeurIPS 2021 DistShift Workshop (on distribution shifts)!
Work by myself\*, JÃ¶rn-Henrik Jacobsen, Olina Chau, Adriel Saporta, Aahlad Puli, Rajesh Ranganath, and Andrew C. Miller. Work done as
part of my internship at Apple Health AI.

* Fall 2021: selected as a recipient of the NeurIPS 2021 Outstanding Reviewer Award: *given to the top 8% of reviewers who were judged to be instrumental to the review process based on Area Chair and author feedback*. Meaningful to me since it was my first time reviewing. Glad to be a part of it!

* Fall 2021: *Inverse-Weighted Survival Games* accepted to NeurIPS 2021! 
A new way to estimate survival models 
by playing games involving both the failure and censoring distribution!
Work by myself\*, Xintian Han\*, Aahlad Puli, Thomas Wies, Adler J. Perotte, and Rajesh Ranganath. [public openreview link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=j4oYd8SGop)

* Summer 2021: working with Apple's Health AI team this summer supervised by [Andy Miller](https://andymiller.github.io/) and team!

<!--
* Spring 2021: some work on games for training survival models in submission! Work by myself\*, Xintian Han\*, Aahlad Puli, Thomas Wies, Adler J. Perotte, and Rajesh Ranganath.

## In a previous life

I was a research assistant and teaching fellow in the computer science department 
at [Harvard SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/).
I am still an on/off TF for the 
[harvard undergrad ML course](https://harvard-ml-courses.github.io/cs181-web/).
Between Harvard and NYU, I worked with the 
[CoCoSci](http://cocosci.mit.edu/) group at 
[MIT BCS](https://bcs.mit.edu/).
Previous to that, I studied music composition, improvisation, and theory 
at New England Conservatory with 
[Anthony Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Coleman),
[Stratis Minakakis](https://www.stratisminakakis.info) 
and [Ran Blake](https://ranblake.com/).
I am still involved with music and rehearse with
[Gamelan Kusuma Laras](https://kusumalaras.org/) a classical Javanese ensemble 
that performs the repetoire of the courts of Central Java.

  <!---
    I'm curious about how we can understand phenomena in and around us
    (e.g. in healthcare, environment, art)
    with a mix of mechanistic and probabilistic explanations.
    For this reason I work on methodology in inference.
    If we then use such models to make decisions, we should explore
    what it means to do so safely.
