## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, [CILVR group](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/),
advised by [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/) and 
[Thomas Wies](https://cs.nyu.edu/wies/), and a student researcher at Google DeepMind. I work on deep generative models
and machine learning for health and science. I'm also a part of the [STAT research group](https://cds.nyu.edu/stat/) at the NYU Center for Data Science. Currently I organize the "generative model foundations" weekly meeting at Courant which brings together CS and math researchers to understand recent generative models together (PIs Eric Vanden-Eijnden, Joan Bruna, and Jon Niles-Weed).

I've started looking for postdoc positions + jobs for summer/fall 2025. Feel free to reach out about this!

## In a previous life

I was a research assistant and teaching fellow in the computer science department 
at [Harvard SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/).
I am still an on/off TF for the 
[harvard undergrad ML course](https://harvard-ml-courses.github.io/cs181-web/).
Between Harvard and NYU, I worked with the 
[CoCoSci](http://cocosci.mit.edu/) group at 
[MIT BCS](https://bcs.mit.edu/).
Previous to that, I studied music composition, improvisation, and theory 
at New England Conservatory with 
[Anthony Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Coleman),
[Stratis Minakakis](https://www.stratisminakakis.info) 
and [Ran Blake](https://ranblake.com/).
I am still involved with music and rehearse with
[Gamelan Kusuma Laras](https://kusumalaras.org/) a classical Javanese ensemble 
that performs the repetoire of the courts of Central Java.

I'm curious about how we can understand phenomena in and around us
    (e.g. in healthcare, environment, art)
    with a mix of mechanistic and probabilistic explanations.
    For this reason I work on methodology in inference.
    If we then use such models to make decisions, we should explore
    what it means to do so safely.

Previously, I was a research assistant and teaching fellow in the Computer Science department at <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard SEAS</a>, 
where I worked primarily with <a href="https://www.seltzer.com/margo/">Margo Seltzer</a> and taught primarily for
<a href="https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/">Finale Doshi-Velez</a> and <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/rush.html">Sasha Rush</a>. Between Harvard and NYU, I worked
with the <a href="http://cocosci.mit.edu/">CoCoSci</a> group at <a href="https://bcs.mit.edu/">MIT BCS</a> on model-based RL under
<a href="https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/tsividis">Pedro Tsividis</a> and <a href="http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh">Josh Tenenbaum</a>.

Thoughts at the moment: In general I care about (1) ml for health (e.g. cardiovascular health) and (2) methodology in generative models, particularly on the diffusion/flow side of things, and for applications like images, video, and PDEs (see work below). 

*What about the intersection of (1) and (2)*? I'm cautious. On the health side, at best, who/why/what can great generative models help? My best guesses at the moment are that conditional generative models, under the right assumptions, can alleviate some issues in messy electronic health records, and that they can be used to test if one high-dimensional modality
may have information about others (which helps when the latter are expensive). On the other hand, health does inspire challenging methods questions: missing data, tabular data, signals, all stuff that's hard to make diffusions/flows work well on. 

Evaluation also feels important, where much of the diffusion literature focuses on FIDs (a measure of image quality) and not likelihoods, and at a community research level, there is potential risk that this is steering methods away from a place where they could be useful for real problems beyond perceptually pleasing images. Work to be done!

I work on survival analysis, 
causal inference, and machine learning for health.
