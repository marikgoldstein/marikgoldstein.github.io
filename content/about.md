I'm Rachit Singh, and I'm a senior at Harvard, doing research in variational inference, Indian Buffet
processes, and language models. I work with [Alexander Rush](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~srush/),
[Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/), and I'm part of the 
[Harvard NLP](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) research group. I frequently work with 
[Jeffrey Ling](http://jeffreyling.github.io/).

I'm very interested in probabilistic programs, especially those like [Edward](https://www.edwardlib.org), and I'm hoping to help build [Pyro](https://pyro.ai) to be just as powerful, once I understand how it works. I like to write very fast code (I have a bit of CUDA + RTOS microcontroller work under my belt) in a variety of languages. Mostly these days that involves writing neural networks in PyTorch or Tensorflow, though I prefer to be Bayesian when possible.
